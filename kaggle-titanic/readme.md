[Kaggle - Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/)
=================================================================================================

Getting Started
===============

I have built this project using docker. Files are generated an stored on the host machine in a folder called `output`.

```bash
docker compose up
```

I mostly drew inspiration from [this guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/arancium/logistic-regression-titanic-score-0-76315)
